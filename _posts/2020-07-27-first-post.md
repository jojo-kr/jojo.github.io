I figured out how to create my blog on GITHUB. When I tried this last year it did not work, but this time I figured out. There are two documents that I referred to when setting this up. The first one was an [introductory post][introductory-post] for setting up Github in Jekyll. The second one is [the source][mmistakes-source] of my blog's format. It was very quick and easy. 

```python
  print("hello git blog")
```
